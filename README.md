#PySat

This is a super basic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver written in Python. The purpose of this project is simply to understand the concepts of SAT solving and not to create a useful solver. 

I used Python to take advantage of the builtin logical operators and ```eval```. 

The Makefile contains a few example executions of the program. 

##Usage

Run the program from the command line. The first and only argument will be used to input the Boolean equation. For example:

```bash
python pysat.py "a and b"
```
